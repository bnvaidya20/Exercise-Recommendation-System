## Features

- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Find users with similar exercise profiles and recommend exercises based on their preferences.
- **Model-Based Recommendations:** Utilize algorithms like SVD, ALS, and KNN to predict user preferences and provide recommendations.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate recommendation models using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and Precision@k.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Display evaluation metrics and insights through interactive charts and graphs.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard:** An intuitive Streamlit-based interface for easy navigation and interaction.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Anaconda (recommended for environment management)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bnvaidya20/Exercise-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Exercise-Recommendation-System
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   conda create --name exercise-reco
   conda activate exercise-reco
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the dataset:**

   Place your dataset (e.g., `exercise_dataset.csv`) in the `health_data/` directory.

5. **Run the Streamlit application:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
